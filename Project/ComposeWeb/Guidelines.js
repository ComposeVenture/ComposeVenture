<h1>Compose Web Guidelines</h1>

<p>
    Compose Web is built purely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It consists of approximately 70% JavaScript, 25% CSS, and 5% HTML. It comes with numerous built-in features and icons to enhance your development experience.
    <br><br>
    Compose Web includes built-in functions and templates designed to boost your productivity. Even if you're not familiar with Single Page Applications (SPAs), you can start with a prebuilt template that includes everything you need. Just clone the code and get started.
    <br><br>
    Compose Web is designed to simplify web development for developers, allowing you to build websites and PWAs simultaneously. It's all pre-installed within the Compose framework.
</p>

<h2>No Dependencies Required</h2>

<p>
    With Compose Web, there's no need to pre-install Node.js or any other dependencies. It comes fully equipped with functions that you would typically need frameworks like React or Angular for. The Compose Development Team has packaged these functions into plain JavaScript components, so you can use them without installing third-party plugins.
</p>

<p>
    Compose Web includes most common elements and components pre-built and pre-styled, such as buttons, headers, divs, and more.
</p>

<h2>Module Support</h2>

<p>
    Compose Web supports both ES6 modules and direct linking, enhancing your workflow and making development faster and more efficient.
